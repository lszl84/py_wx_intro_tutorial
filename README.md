## Project Overview

Full Tutorial: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnY2yXWIAl4)

This simple Python script uses `wxPython` to show a window, a file dialog and a multiline text control. When the user selects a file, the script reads the file and displays the contents in the text control.

## System Requirements

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following tools and libraries:

- **Python 3.11+**
- **wxPython 4.2.1+**

## Running

To run the project, simply execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Remember to install the required libraries first. I recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.
